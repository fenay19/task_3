# 🌍 Population Classification & Visualization - 2023

This project (`task_3.ipynb`) focuses on analyzing and visualizing population data, and includes a classification task to predict categories (e.g., region or tier) using machine learning.

## 📌 Objective

- Visualize the global population distribution using both static and interactive plots.
- Train a classification model (Decision Tree) to predict labels based on population-related features.
